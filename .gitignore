# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

#    NB: also, whitelist the default ones, some projects need to use these

# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings
#
#
# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
#     - unless they are "shared")
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below
xcuserdata
 
# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above

#     (requires option 2 above): Personal Schemes

# XCode 4 workspaces - more detailed
#
# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't exclude them :)
#
# Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
#
# /(root)/
#   /(project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     /project.xcworkspace/
#       contents.xcworkspacedata

#         /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#           UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate
#     /xcsshareddata/
#       /xcschemes/
#         (shared scheme name).xcscheme
#     /xcuserdata/
